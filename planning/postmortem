Final Notes:

- MVP was achieved.
- Extra features are 'deals today' on homepage and 'spicy/veg' options
  on add and display.
- Designed to be suitable for mobile display without actually being
  responsive.

- Update functionality was an oversight - by the time I remebered to
  include it, I realised I didn't immediately know how to do it in
  the dropdown system, so had to leave it out or risk breaking what
  worked.
