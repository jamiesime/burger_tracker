Friday:

Today I started by outlining the basic use cases for the eventual
burger tracker site, and then scribbled down what classes I need
and what their likely attributes and methods would be, and turned
that into an initial class diagram, which is likely to change.

Then I filled in all of the CRUD methods for each of the classes
that needed them. Next was to put in a few methods I'd identified
in the class diagram - find_burgers and find_deals in the eatery
class.

The next thing to do is to find all the burgers currently related
to a specific deal. This might need a join table (ie burger_deal),
or I could add an attribute to burger, deal_id, but not all burgers
will be a part of a deal at all times. A join table might be best.

UPDATE:

I have created a function in Deal.rb which inner joins from
burgers and deals on their ids, to get the ids of all of the
classes in one result. From this, I will be able to create a
view which cycles through each class looking for those ids
and where they match, and then display them organised in some
format via HTML/CSS.
